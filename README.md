# Pseudo Classes
#### Practice of implementing pseudo-selectors in CSS styling

### Directives

Given the contents for `index.html`, no further classes or id's were to be added to complete the following:

* Add correct styles to remove the bullets from all `<li>` elements and display them as inline elements.
* The three `<span>` elements should be displayed as block elements with a 1 pixel border and 25 pixel margin on **all** sides.
* In the `article` element with the class `n-child`, add a 1 pixel border around every even numbered section element.
